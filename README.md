# INDIVIDUAL-PROJECT-FOR-SLOT-NG-TEAM-BUG-HUNTER
This repository contains a Selenium IDE test that walks through the full ordering process on Slot NG as an existing customer. The test covers everything from browsing through product phone and tablets categories and adding an item to the cart, to choosing a delivery address and attempting to pay with an invalid card. It also checks that the right error message appears and handles closing the payment iFrame well.
